* About =emacs.sh=

  This file was put here to serve as a initializer for GUI emacs from the terminal. I have only experienced this issue on MacOS.

* Setup for =emacs.sh=

  On a new box, copy =emacs.sh= to the desired user binaries directory. On Mac, at the time of writing, this should be =/usr/local/bin=

  After confirming the script is at the appropriate location, make sure you alias to the right script in your .bashrc or what have you.

* About c-*

Bash script to serve as custom utilities for myself to reduce redundant actions.

First task, encrypt/decrypt files using the appropriate keys.
